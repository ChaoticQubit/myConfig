name: to-features
description: Take a single release markdown file (typically the output of `to-releases`) and produce one feature/epic markdown per major feature in that release. Each feature markdown captures problem, solution overview, user stories, acceptance criteria, out-of-scope items, dependencies, technical considerations, and open questions. Use whenever the user has a release plan and wants to expand it into actual features/epics for implementation, or asks to "break this release into features", "what are the epics for v2", "list the features in this release", "expand this release into specs", or "turn this release into Linear epics".

# To Features
 
Take a release plan and break it into the discrete features (or epics, in Linear's vocabulary) that make up that release. Each feature is a coherent piece of user-visible functionality that can be specced and assigned to a team.
 
Features are NOT vertical slices yet — that's `to-issues`'s job. Features are the bridge between "v2 is about personal finance tracking" and "implement the dashboard chart component".
 
This skill applies the Linear Method to feature-level specs. The principles that matter most here:
 
- **Solve problems, not features.** Even when writing a "feature", anchor it in the user problem it solves.
- **Specs force scoping.** Writing the spec surfaces gaps and forces priorities to be clear.
- **Brief is better.** Short specs get read. Communicate why, what, and how — not every implementation detail.
- **One owner per feature.** Even if multiple people contribute, one person is responsible.
- **User stories are useful at the spec level**, not the issue level. Use them here to articulate user value, but resist treating them as task descriptions.
If the `linear-method` skill is installed, see it for fuller context.
 
## Process
 
### 1. Read the release file
 
Take the release markdown the user references (path in their message, file in conversation context, or the most recent output of `to-releases`). Read the whole thing — theme, in scope, out of scope, dependencies. The "Out of scope" section matters as much as "In scope": features that try to pull in deferred items break the release plan.
 
### 2. Identify the features
 
A feature is a coherent piece of user-visible functionality that:
- Maps to one or more user stories
- Has clear acceptance criteria
- Could be assigned to one person or a small group as a unit of work
- Typically takes 1–3 weeks to ship end-to-end (in line with Linear Method's project sizing)
If a "feature" feels like 6+ weeks, split it. If two "features" can't be tested independently, they might be one feature with sub-parts.
 
For each candidate feature, ask:
- What user problem does this solve?
- What does "done" look like from a user's perspective?
- What other features in this release does it depend on?
- What's deliberately NOT part of this feature?
### 3. Draft each feature
 
Use the template below. Save to `./output/features/<release-slug>/<feature-slug>.md` (e.g. `./output/features/v1-split-and-settle/expense-splitting.md`).
 
<feature-template>
# <Feature Title>
 
**Release:** v<N> — <Release Codename>
**Status:** Draft
**Owner:** TBD
 
## Problem
 
The user-side problem this feature solves. One or two sentences. Anchor in the user, not the implementation.
 
## Solution overview
 
What this feature does, from the user's perspective. Two or three sentences.
 
## User stories
 
A numbered list. Format: "As a <user>, I want <capability>, so that <benefit>."
 
These describe user value, not tasks. They're a checklist for "have we covered the relevant cases", not work units.
 
1. As a ..., I want ..., so that ...
2. As a ..., I want ..., so that ...
## Acceptance criteria
 
Checklist of observable behaviors that must be true for this feature to be "done". Behavior, not implementation.
 
- [ ] ...
- [ ] ...
## Out of scope
 
What is deliberately NOT in this feature. Things that would feel related but are deferred, or belong in a different feature.
 
## Dependencies
 
Other features in this release (or earlier releases) that must be done first. Or "None — can start immediately."
 
## Technical considerations
 
Architectural choices, third-party integrations, data model decisions, or known constraints the implementing team needs to know. Keep this brief — it's a flag, not a design doc.
 
## Open questions
 
Things not yet decided that should be resolved before implementation starts.

### 4. Show the feature list and quiz the user
 
Before saving, present a summary table:
 
| # | Feature | Rough size | Depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ... | ~1 week | None |
| 2 | ... | ~2 weeks | #1 |
 
Then ask:
- Are any features sized too big? (>3 weeks suggests it should be split)
- Are any features overlapping or genuinely the same thing?
- Are there gaps — anything in the release's "In scope" not covered?
- Any feature pulling in deferred (out-of-scope) items? Those need to either drop or move to a later release.
Iterate until the user approves, then write the markdown files.
 
### 5. Offer to publish to Linear
 
After saving, ask: "Want me to publish these as Linear issues (epics) under the release?"
 
If yes, recap one line per feature and confirm once more before calling MCP tools. Then:
 
- For each feature, call `save_issue` with the title and a body composed from the markdown
- Apply an "epic" label if the workspace uses one (check via `list_issue_labels` first)
- If the user has a project for this release, set the project ID on each issue
- Otherwise create the issues at the workspace level and tell the user where they landed
If the user says no, confirm the markdown files are in `./output/features/<release-slug>/` and stop.
 
## Anti-patterns to avoid
 
- **Re-introducing deferred scope.** A feature in v2 that pulls in something the v2 release doc said was out of scope is a sign of weak release boundaries. Push back instead of papering over it.
- **Features that aren't user-visible.** "Refactor the auth module" isn't a feature — it's a tech-debt issue. Features deliver user-visible outcomes.
- **Acceptance criteria written as tasks.** "Add a button to the toolbar" is a task. "User can save an expense from the dashboard in one click" is acceptance criteria.
- **User stories as tasks.** Don't write "As a developer, I want to write tests..." — that's not a user story. Save tasks for `to-issues`.
- **Massive features.** If a feature feels like a small project on its own, split it into 2–3 features that ship independently.
