description: Take a product scope or ideation document and produce one Linear project markdown per natural area of work (e.g., authentication, frontend, payments, infrastructure, observability, design system). Each markdown contains title, description, goals, milestones, lead/owner placeholder, color suggestion, and dependencies — everything needed to publish as a Linear project. Use whenever the user has a broad product scope and wants to organize work into Linear projects, asks "help me set up Linear projects for this", "group this into projects", "turn this scope into Linear-ready project briefs", "what projects should I create in Linear", or "set up a Linear workspace structure for this product".

# To Linear Projects
 
Take a product scope and produce a set of Linear project briefs — one per natural area of work. In this skill's vocabulary, a "project" is a categorical area (Authentication, Payments, Frontend, Data Platform), not a strict 1–3 week chunk. Within each project, milestones capture the smaller time-bounded chunks that match Linear Method's project-sizing guidance.
 
This is orthogonal to `to-releases`: projects describe **what areas of work exist**, releases describe **when things ship**. A single project (e.g., Authentication) typically has milestones spread across multiple releases.
 
This skill applies the Linear Method to project organization. The principles that matter most here:
 
- **Meaningful direction.** Every project should clearly state why it matters and what success looks like.
- **One named owner.** Every project has one person responsible for the brief and delivery, even if many contribute.
- **Specs force scoping.** Writing the project brief surfaces what belongs and what doesn't.
- **Plain language.** Use the project's domain vocabulary. Don't invent jargon.
- **Reserve room for unplanned work.** Project timelines should leave space for things that come up.
If the `linear-method` skill is installed, see it for fuller context.
 
## Process
 
### 1. Read the scope
 
Work from whatever is already in the conversation context (uploaded file, pasted text). If the user passes a path, read the file.
 
### 2. Identify the natural project boundaries
 
A good project:
- Covers one coherent area of capability
- Has a single team or owner who can be accountable
- Can accumulate milestones over time as the product evolves
- Doesn't overlap heavily with other projects (some boundary blur is fine)
Common axes for software products:
- **Capability areas** (Authentication, Payments, Notifications, Search)
- **Surface areas** (Mobile App, Web App, Public API)
- **Platform layers** (Infrastructure, Observability, CI/CD)
- **Domain features** (e.g. for a finance app: Expense Tracking, Splitting, Places & Profile)
- **Cross-cutting concerns** (Design System, Testing, Security & Compliance)
Aim for 6–12 projects total for a sizable product scope. Fewer than five usually means projects are too broad; more than fifteen means likely overlap or projects too granular.
 
### 3. Draft each project
 
Use the template below. Save each to `./output/projects/<project-slug>.md` (e.g. `auth-and-authorization.md`).
 
<project-template>
# <Project Title>
 
**Lead:** TBD
**Status:** Backlog
**Color:** <suggest one — pick a varied palette across projects>
 
## Description
 
Two to four sentences. What this project covers, why it exists, and how it fits into the broader product. Use the project's domain vocabulary.
 
## Goals
 
What success looks like for this project. Measurable where possible. Outcomes, not a feature list.
 
- ...
- ...
## Milestones
 
Time-bounded chunks of work within this project. Each milestone should be roughly 1–3 weeks of work for 1–3 people, in line with Linear Method's project-sizing guidance. Milestones are the unit at which this project ships value, even though the project itself is long-running.
 
| # | Milestone | Rough size | Maps to release |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ... | ~2 weeks | v1 |
| 2 | ... | ~1 week | v1 |
| 3 | ... | ~3 weeks | v2 |
 
## Dependencies
 
Other projects this depends on, and projects that depend on this one. Or "None — can run independently".
 
- **Depends on:** ...
- **Blocks:** ...
## Out of scope
 
What does NOT belong in this project even though someone might think it does. Make the boundary explicit.
 
## Open questions
 
Things to decide as this project gets going.
 
</project-template>
**Color palette suggestion** — when assigning colors, pick from a varied palette so projects are visually distinct in Linear. Reasonable options: indigo, emerald, amber, rose, sky, violet, lime, orange, teal, fuchsia.
 
### 4. Show the project list and quiz the user
 
Before saving, present a summary table:
 
| Project | Lead | # of milestones | Mapped releases |
|---|---|---|---|
| Authentication & Authorization | TBD | 4 | v1, v2, v5 |
| Frontend (Flutter) | TBD | 6 | v1, v2, v3, v4 |
 
Then ask:
- Are the project boundaries right, or are any overlapping?
- Are there areas of the scope that don't fit cleanly into any project? (Indicates a missing project.)
- Any projects too small to justify being top-level? (Could be milestones inside another project.)
- Any too broad? (Could be split into 2–3 projects.)
Iterate until the user approves, then save the markdown files.
 
### 5. Offer to publish to Linear
 
After saving, ask: "Want me to publish these as Linear projects?"
 
If yes, recap one line per project and confirm once more before calling MCP tools. Then for each project:
 
- Call `save_project` with title, description, status (`backlog`), and color
- For each milestone in the project's milestones table, call `save_milestone` with the project ID
- If the user has a specific team for these projects, set the team ID; otherwise ask once which team to put them under
If the user says no, confirm the markdown files are in `./output/projects/` and stop.
 
## Anti-patterns to avoid
 
- **One mega-project.** "Backend" or "Frontend" alone is usually too broad. Split by capability area.
- **Projects without an owner-shape.** If you can't picture one person being accountable, the boundary is wrong.
- **Projects that are really features.** "Add Apple Pay support" is a feature/issue, not a project. A project should accommodate ongoing work over months.
- **Inventing jargon.** Use words from the user's scope document. Don't rename "Expenses" to "Transactions" because it sounds more enterprisey.
- **Skipping milestones.** A project with no milestones has no scope; it's just a folder. Always include a milestone breakdown.
